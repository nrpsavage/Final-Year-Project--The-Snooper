# Final-Year-Project--The-Snooper
A vulnerability inteligence application.

This application is made with HTML, CSS, Python and MySQL.

There are multiple branches in this project with each being a different version of my code.
Branches 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 are my original code however due to some issues that code had to be abandoned.
Please look at the branches after for more up to date versions of the code.
The finished version and the main one to look at will be:

V.1.0 DONE

With the other version showing work done and the differences between each step in the projects progression.

To run code: Run code on the main.py code and from there open http://127.0.0.1:5000 to see the page.
The MySQL Query will be put into a txt file in the finished branch.
